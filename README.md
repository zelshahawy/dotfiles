## Personal Dotfile config primarily managed by Home Manager

Please note that I am using personal configurations that are not reflected in the directory, but still affect the dotfiles managed
and more (such as setting Term to kitty). Therefore, be responsible when using this in your computer as it might break things...

Without further ado, pleaase enjoy.
